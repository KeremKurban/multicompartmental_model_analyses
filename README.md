## Tutorial for Neuron and Published Models

Examples :

1. example2.py : loads a morphology and analyzes dendrites over path distance. injects passive current mechanism and runs a current clamp to check signal propagation within neuron
2. example3.py : defines a cell class and imports a given SWC morphology file , plots the neuron and injects a current after inserting hh mech to the soma and axon and passive mech to the dendrites
