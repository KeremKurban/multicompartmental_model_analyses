# Channels

### Kir2

Kir2 channel is an important component of terminal cardiac repolarization and resting membrane stability. It is a member of the inward rectifier potassium channel family and is expressed by both capillary and arteriolar endothelial cells. Kir2 channels play critical roles in mediating vasodilation and amplifying membrane hyperpolarization. They contribute to stabilization of the resting membrane potential and action potential repolarization in excitable cells. Kir2.1, encoded by the KCNJ2 gene, is a member of the classic inwardly rectifying potassium channel family. It plays biophysical roles in various arterial VSMCs. The channels of the Kir2 family are activated by external K+ and require phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) for activity. Loss-of-function mutations in KCNJ2 can cause genetic sudden cardiac death syndromes. Kir2 channels have become a tipping point for electrical maturity in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CMs) and are important to consider for Comprehensive In Vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) and drug safety testing.

nterestingly, increasing the Kir conductance (see Appendix 2 for details) was sufficient to replicate mature rat GC I-V recordings (Pourbadie et al., 2015) using rat morphologies (Figure 4B). Also, after the adjustment of the Kir conductance, active channel properties and densities from mouse GCs (Table 1) reproduced the spiking behavior of rat GCs (Figure 4Câ€“D).

 This suggests that the Kir conductance is a key determinant of the intrinsic excitability of GCs and that the differences in the Kir conductance between mouse and rat GCs are sufficient to explain the differences in their intrinsic excitability. 

### K2P

K2P channels are a family of leak K^+ channels that are present in different tissues, including neurons, and are involved in setting resting membrane potentials. They consist of 15 members and are highly relevant to sensory functions due to their high mechanical and thermal sensitivity. Three subtypes, TRAAK, TREK-1, and TREK-2, are particularly important for sensory functions. K2P channels are involved in various physiological processes and have been implicated in different pathological conditions. They are a mechanosensitive family of protein channels that allow for the passive transport of K^+ ions through the membrane. K2P channels are widely expressed in the central nervous system and regulate action potential maintenance and synaptic transmission. They have attracted interest as a potential target for neurodegenerative diseases ("<bbs_sources>").
